# Fitness API Service

## Overview

The Fitness API Service is a RESTful API designed to manage a fitness center's operations, including handling coaches, fitness classes, and user registrations. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting information about coaches, classes, and registrations. This API is built using FastAPI and uses JSON files for data storage.

## Features

- **Coaches Management**: Add new coaches, retrieve coach details, update coach information, and delete coaches from the system.
- **Fitness Classes Management**: Manage fitness class schedules, including adding new classes, updating class details, and deleting classes.
- **User Registrations**: Handle user registrations for fitness classes, allowing users to sign up for classes and retrieve their registration details.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- FastAPI
- Uvicorn (for running the API server)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using `pip`:

### Running the Server
